      <h1>Malik Robinson</h1>

      <p>
        If you couldn't tell from the large font, my name is Malik. I am an aspiring front-end developer based in Charlotte, North Carolina, that enjoys creating unique web pages and writing code. I was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and moved to Charlotte at 10 years old with my family. My love for web development started my senior year of high school when I took an E-commerce class. The thrill I got from writing code on my computer and seeing the result on a web page was not explainable. After graduating high school, I was forced into this thing called “adulting” and began working A LOT of customer service jobs to earn a living. Often times feeling that my life wasn’t going anywhere since I couldn’t afford college. That narrow road that I found myself driving down came to a much-appreciated stop when I discovered a program that would have a huge impact on the nerd I am today. In June of 2017, I was accepted into Road to Hire, which is a very intense four-month program that taught me the skills I needed to break into the web development field.
