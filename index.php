          Welcome to my Portfolio Site! I am an apsiring front-end web developer. This site will give you a little information about who I am, showcase my design skills, and show some examples of the work I've worked on over the past four months of training.

        <h1>Why Front-End?</h1>
        <p>
          We live in a generation that is very reliant on technology. I know for a fact that I spent a good amount of hours online, either I was watching singing videos on YouTube or I was checking out Tumblr post that gave me the inspiration I needed to actually call myself a photographer. During that time of hours being spent online, I was always curious as to how sites were made, who designed them, and how complicated it must have been to get that site up and running. That intrigued me so much that I decided to pursue a career on the Front End side of Web Development. I have always been a visual learner and get a thrill from seeing the things that I create.
